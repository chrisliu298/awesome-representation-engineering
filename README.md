This repository tracks the latest research on representation engineering (RepE), which was originally introduced by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405). The goal is to offer a comprehensive list of papers and resources relevant to the topic. Work that falls under the umbrella of representation engineering are also included.

> [!NOTE]
> If you believe your paper on representation engineering (or related topics) is not included, or if you find a mistake, typo, or information that is not up to date, please open an issue, and I will address it as soon as possible.
>
> If you want to add a new paper, feel free to either open an issue or create a pull request.

Also:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Note that representation engineering is a relatively new framework, so the categorization below reflects my subjective understanding of the techniques. The first table includes work that explicitly uses the term "representation engineering." Other closely related work is grouped in the later tables.*
>
> If you disagree with the categorization or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know by opening an issue.
